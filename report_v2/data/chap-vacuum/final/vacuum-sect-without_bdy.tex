\section{Non-confined case}\label{vacuum-without_bdy}
We consider in this section a non-confined space-time $\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}$ with a constant electric field $E$ and a Kondo-type potential at $x^1 = 0$.
Contrary to the confined case, quantized energy levels are no longer expected. 
Furthermore, since the space is not compact, Dirac fields are required to be normalized in the sense of distribution (to a $\delta$-distribution).

%Compared to the confined case, when we enlarge the confined space by doing $L \rightarrow \infty$, 
%the results of~\cref{sect-nef} and~\cref{vacuum-sect-field} coincide with the results of~\cref{vacuum-without_bdy}.
%Meanwhile, the charge density in the case with external electric field~\cref{vacuum-charge_nbdy} implies a diverged total charge.
%In effect, this situation should not really be concerned since a constant electric field in an infinite space is not physically possible.
