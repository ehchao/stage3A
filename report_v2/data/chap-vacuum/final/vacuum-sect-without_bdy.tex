\section{Non-confined case}\label{vacuum-without_bdy}
We consider in this section a non-confined space with a Kondo potential at $x^1 = 0$.
In contrary to the previous setting, the mode spectrum is not expected to be quantized.
Furthermore, since the space is not compact, fields are no longer required to be normalized in the usual way but in the sense of distribution (to a $\delta$-function).

Compared to the confined case, when we enlarge the confined space by doing $L \rightarrow \infty$, 
the results of~\cref{sect-nef} and~\cref{vacuum-sect-field} coincide with the results of~\cref{vacuum-without_bdy}.
Meanwhile, the charge density in the case with external electric field~\cref{vacuum-charge_nbdy} implies a diverged total charge.
In effect, this situation should not really be concerned since a constant electric field in an infinite space is not physically possible.
