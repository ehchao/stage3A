\subsection{Linearized system}
Let us begin by studying~\cref{ym-dyn} up to first order in $A$ and $\bar{A}$. 
We define the operator $G_L$ with
\begin{equation}
G_L (A, E, \bar{A}, \bar{E}) = (E, -\dd^c \dd A, \bar{E}, -\dd^c \dd \bar{A} + c^{-1} A_\bot)
\end{equation}
where $A_\bot$ is the component of $A$ which is perpendicular to the boundary (inward directed). \\\\
