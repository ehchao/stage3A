\section{Introduction}
The main goal of this work is to generalize the bag boundary condition proposed in~\cite{Chodos1974}
by introducing the derivatives of the wave function in the boundary condition for any Lorentzian manifold $M$. 
For this purpose, we introduce the following action
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{S} = \frac{1}{2}i\int_M \bar{\psi} \gamma^\mu \partial_\mu \psi - \partial_\mu \bar{\psi} \gamma^\mu \psi 
+ \frac{1}{2}\int_{\partial M} ic \bar{\psi} \gamma^\alpha \partial_\alpha (1 - i \gamma^\bot) \psi
+ \bar{\psi} \psi
\end{equation}
for a certain constant $c >0$. 
$\gamma^\bot$ here represents the component perpendicular to $\partial M$ in the incoming direction. \\
When $c \rightarrow 0$, the boundary condition becomes the bag condition. 
Furthermore, we suppose that $\psi$ and $\partial_\mu \psi$ vanish at $\partial(\partial M)$. 
By variational method, we can derive the equations of motion in the bulk and on the boundary
\begin{equation}\label{wen-motion}
\begin{cases}
i \gamma^\mu \partial_\mu \psi = 0  \quad \textrm{in $M$}\\
i \gamma^\alpha \partial_\alpha (1 - i\gamma^\bot) \psi = - c^{-1}(1 + i\gamma^{\bot}) \psi \quad \textrm{on $\partial M$}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
We define $\phi = \gamma^0 \psi$. 
\cref{wen-motion} can be written as 
\begin{equation}
\begin{cases}
i \partial_0 \phi = i \gamma^0 \gamma^j \partial_j \phi   \quad \textrm{in $M$}\\
i \partial_0(1 + i\gamma^\bot) \phi = i\gamma^0 \gamma^a \partial_a (1+ i\gamma^\bot)\phi - c^{-1} \gamma^0(1 - i \gamma^{\bot})\phi \quad \textrm{on $\partial M$}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
Where Latin letters are used to enumerate the spatial components.\\
One can notice that the boundary condition implies constraints on only a part of components of $\psi$. 
For instance, for $\dim M = 3$, we can construct the following generator of Clifford Algebra as suggested in~\cite{Polchinski1998}
\begin{equation*}
\gamma^0 = i\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ -1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}  \quad
\gamma^1 = i\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}  \quad
\gamma^2 = i\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix}  
\end{equation*}
Suppose that the normal vector of $\partial M$ is $e_2$ at all point.
We have
\begin{equation*}
1 - i\gamma^\bot = 
\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 0 & 0\end{pmatrix} = 2 \mathcal{P}
\end{equation*}
where $\mathcal{P}$ is one of the chiral projectors.
In order to define the domain of the Hamiltonian of the problem, the following lemma is needed 
\begin{lemma}\label{wen-proj}
Let $\gamma^\mu$ a set of generator of a Clifford Algebra in $d$-dimension. 
Then, for all spatial component $j \in \llbracket 1, d-1 \rrbracket$
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{P}_\pm = \frac{1}{2}(1 \pm i\gamma^j) 
\end{equation*}
are orthogonal Hermitian projectors for the usual inner product $\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle _{L^2(\Omega)}$, where $\Omega$ is a Hilbert space.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
In the usual case, we require the current $j^\mu = \bar{\psi} \gamma^\mu \psi $, where $\psi$ is the solution of the Dirac equation (the equation in the bulk of \cref{wen-motion}) to be Hermitian.
\ie 
\begin{equation*}
j^\mu 
= \bar{\psi}\gamma^\mu\psi 
= \psi^\dagger\gamma^0 \gamma^\mu \psi
= \psi^\dagger(\gamma^\mu)^\dagger (\gamma^0)^\dagger \psi
=  (j^\mu)^\dagger
\end{equation*}
%TODO to be continued for the hermiticity
For any spatial component $j$, we define $\mathcal{P}_\pm = \frac{1}{2}(1 \pm i\gamma^j)$.
Obviously, $\mathcal{P}_\pm$ are Hermitian since
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{P}_\pm^\dagger = 
\frac{1}{2}(1 \mp i (\gamma^j)^\dagger)=
\frac{1}{2}(1 \pm i \gamma^j)
\end{equation*}
It is clear that $(\mathcal{P}_\pm)^{2} = \frac{1}{4}(2\pm 2i \gamma^\bot) = \mathcal{P}_\pm$.
Furthermore, they have the same rank (equal to the half of the $n$-dimension of the representation space) since $\gamma^0$ is of maximal rank and
\begin{equation*}
\gamma^0\mathcal{P}_\pm = \mathcal{P}_\mp\gamma^0
\end{equation*}
Finally, by the Hermicity of $\mathcal{P}_{\pm}$, we have
\begin{equation*}
\langle \mathcal{P}_- \phi, \mathcal{P}_+ \psi \rangle = 
\langle \phi, \mathcal{P}_-\mathcal{P}_+ \psi \rangle = 0
\end{equation*}
which shows the two projectors are orthogonal.
\end{proof}
As a result, \cref{wen-proj} ensures that the projectors $\mathcal{P}_\pm$ are not identically null and that the projection spaces by both projectors are of equal dimension. 
Thus, one can define an operator $\Delta$ on the     %TODO On what?
\begin{equation}
\Delta = \begin{pmatrix}
i \gamma^0 \gamma^j \partial_j  & 0 \\
-c^{-1} \gamma^0 \mathcal{P}_- \cdot \vert_{\partial M}&  i\gamma^0 \gamma^a \partial_a \mathcal{P}_+
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
where $j \in \llbracket 1 , d-1 \rrbracket$ and $a \in \llbracket 1 , d-2 \rrbracket$. 
This notation will be adopted in the following.
