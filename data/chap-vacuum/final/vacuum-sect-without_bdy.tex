\section{Non-confined case}\label{vacuum-without_bdy}
In a non-confined space with a Kondo potential at $x^1 = 0$,
quantized momenta are not expected.
Furthermore, the solutions are not normalization in the usual sense but in the sense of distribution (to a $\delta$-function). 
However, it is also interesting to see how the vacuum is polarized in this case.
