\section{Non-confined case}\label{vacuum-without_bdy}
We consider in this section a non-confined space with a Kondo potential at $x^1 = 0$.
In contrary to the previous setting, the spectrum of modes is not expected to be quantized.
Furthermore, since the space is not compact, fields are no longer required to be normalized in the usual way but in the sense of distribution (to a $\delta$-function). 
%However, it is also interesting to see how the vacuum is polarized in this case.
